# BTM Reddit Bot

This was created by me as an unofficial reddit bot for [Black Tea Motorbikes](https://www.blackteamotorbikes.com/). I built this as a practice/passion project
and thought it could be useful for the company with social media presence, though I understand they're not interested.

In any case, this monitors the RSS feed for their YouTube channel and the Atom feed for their blog page. When a new YouTube video is posted, it posts the link along with the title.
When a new blog post is made, it converts the HTML into MarkDown and submits the whole post to reddit (with a link to the original at the end).

It's not too complex, but it helped me learn PRAW/the Reddit API for fun.
